# **Student Depression Prediction using Machine Learning**  

Project Overview 
Mental health plays a critical role in student well-being. This project aims to predict the likelihood of **depression among students** based on factors such as **academic pressure, work stress, sleep duration, dietary habits, and financial stress** using Machine Learning.

## ðŸš€ **Technologies Used**  
- Python(Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)  
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
 

#Dataset
The dataset consists of 18 features related to student lifestyle and mental health, including:  
- Demographics: Gender, Age, City, Degree  
- Academic Factors:CGPA, Study Satisfaction, Work/Study Hours  
- Lifestyle Factors:Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, Financial Stress  
- Mental Health History:Family History of Mental Illness, Suicidal Thoughts  
- Target Variable: Depression (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  

Approach & Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handled missing values and categorical encoding  
   - Standardized numerical features  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualized correlations between lifestyle factors and depression  
   - Checked feature distributions and outliers  

3. Model Training & Evaluation
   - Trained a Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators  
   - Evaluated performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**  

Results
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting student depression  
- Identified key factors influencing mental health  
- Model can aid **educators, counselors, and mental health professionals** in early intervention
